# Hyperlinks

## 1.  Links
* Links are what make the Web a Web
* The interlinked nature of the web leads to the "knowledge" that search engine appear to have

## 2. Anchor Links
```<a href="http:..www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>```
* The `<a>` tag stands for *anchor link*
* Needs a hyper-reference AND content
    * <font color="orange">href</font>: reference to location of new content
    * content: the "clickable" part (text or image)

## 3. Types of Links
* Absolute  
```
<a href="http://www.intro-webdesign.com/">Web Design</a>
```
* Relative  
```
<!-- Linkd to a local file in the same folder -->
<a href="page2.html">Second Page</a>

<!-- Link to a local file in a different folder called "docs" -->
<a href="docs/page2.html">Second Page</a>

<!-- Link to a different location in the same file -->
<a href="#history">History section</a>
```
> Absoulte vs Relative  
> * Absolute: when linking to external links
> * Relative: when developing my own website
> * Your links should NEVER have folders that are specific to your computer  
>    * e.g. C:/page2.html
>    * Doesn't make sense when published
 
* Internal (Embedded)
* Graphical

## 4. Usability Issues

* Make sure the clickable component has an informative name
* Information in the images should be available to those who can't see the image

## 5. Targets
* Anchors can take a target attribute
    * _self - default action
    * _blank - open in new tab or window
    * _top and _parent

## Review
* A page without links is rare
* Links can be absolute, relative, and internal
