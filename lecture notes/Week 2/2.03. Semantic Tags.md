# Semantic Tags

## 1. How to Design
* The most important step in web design is the *design*
* You need to clear picture of what you want to create, before you can begin coding
<center><img src="../../img/building-structure.png/" width = 500 ></center>

## 2. Using Semantic Tags
* In the beginning there was `<div>`
* `<div>` was a way to group related content together
* Divs almost always had special classes/id associated with them
```
<div class="header">...</div>
<div class="section">...</div>
<div class="footer">...</div>
```
### 01. `<header>`
* A group of introductory or navigational adis: title, navigation links, etc
```
<header>
    <h1>This is the Titie</h1>
    <h2>The author is Colleen</h2>
</header>
```
* Not to be confused with `<head>` or the different headings.

### 02. `<nav>`
* A section of the page that links to other pages or to parts within the page
```
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li>
        <li><a href="#history">History</a></li>
        <li><a href="#development">Development</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```
* Often found in the `<header>` tag

### 03. `<footer>`
* A section that contains info such as copyright data, related documents, and links to social media
```
<footer>
    &copy; 2015 by Colleen van Lent<br>
    <a href="http://www.intro-webdesign.com/HTML5">Introduction to HTML5</a>
</footer>
```
* Typically at the bottom of the page, but not required

### 04. `<figure>`
* More semantic than `<img>`, including:
    * caption
    * multiple multi-media resources
```
<figure>
    <img src="sunset.gif" alt="Ashtabula sunset">
    <figcaption>
        A sunset over Lake Erie. Taken in Ashtabula Ohio
    </figcaption>
</figure>
```

## Review
* The age of `<div>` is ending
* Semantic tags help guide users to information in your page
