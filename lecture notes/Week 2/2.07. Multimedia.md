# Multimedia

## 1. HTML5 Multimedia
* Designed to avoid the use of extra software to play music/video
* Not fully implemented

## 2. Video Element `<video>`
* Video tag uses a src attribute or embedded `<source>`
* Common attributes
    * height, width
    * autoplay
    * loop
    * controls
* Text inside `<video>`...`<video>` is displayed if browser cannot support tag

## 3. Audio Element `<audio>`
* Audio tag uses a src attribute to link to audio file, typically .mp3 or .wav
* Commont attributes
    * autoplay, controls, loop
    * buffered
    * muted
    * volume

## 4. Setting Clips
* You can set both the video and audio elements to play clips by adding to the src attribute
    * .ext#t=5, 25
    * .ext#t=, 39
    * .ext#t=, 1:38:45
    * .ext#t=42

## 5. Plugins
* Before HTML5 there was no standard for video display, plugins were required
* Since not all browsers support new tag some may require Flash

## 6. Accessibility Issues
* Make sure to provide links to plugins
* Include text descriptions and closed captioning (or other equivalent content)
* Multimedia should enhance your content, not be a distraction
