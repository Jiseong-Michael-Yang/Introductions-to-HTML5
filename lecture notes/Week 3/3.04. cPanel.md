# cPanel

## 1. Connecting to cPanel
* You will need to have the URL for your cPanel account
    * Usally a version of your domain name or your hosting service domain name

## 2. File Manager
* Regardless of the cPanel configuration, every system should have a File Manager
* From the File Manager, search for the public_html (or in some cases, just public) folder

### 01. public_html
* Your site will have a lot of files, some that you want people to see, some that you don't
* Uploading files to the public_html folder should make them viewable to the public

### 02. Errors
* You typed in the wrong URL
* When you uploaded the file, the transfer didn't work
* When you uploaded the file, it did not have "read access"

## 3. Working Locally
* It is possible to edit your files via cPanel but not recommended
    * Changes are immediately public
    * Less opportunity to test and debug

## Review
* Versions of cPanel often differ depending on if you are using paid or free site
* Offers many administrative tools (email accounts, database management, cron jobs)
* An alternative is to use sftp to transfer files
