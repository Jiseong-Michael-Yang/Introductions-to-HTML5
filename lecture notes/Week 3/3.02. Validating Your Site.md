# Validating Your Site

## 1. Why Validate?
* Browsers are the helicopter parents of programming
* As your pages become more complex "hidden" areas can be devastating

## 2. [Code Validation](https://validator.w3.org)
* Three Approaches
    * Validate by URI
    * Validate by Filename
    * Validate by Direct Input
* Don't Freak Out!
    * Errors propagate, so always start at the top
    * Search for solutions online and in forums
* Accessibility Validation
    * You can use [wave.webaim.org](https://wave.webaim.org) to validate accessibility

## Review
* Validated sites are more robust and more accessible
