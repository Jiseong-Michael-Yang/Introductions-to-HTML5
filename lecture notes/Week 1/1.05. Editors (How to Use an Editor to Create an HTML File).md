# Editors: How to use an editor to create an HTML file

## 1. Creating and Editing Your Files
1. Decide how you will organize your files
2. Decide on a naming convention
3. Decide on an editor

## 2. Getting Started
1. Open your editor
2. Select Save or Save As and name your file. You may need to create a new folder first.
3. Add Doctype, head, and body tags
4. Save File (Ctrl-S)
5. Open in browser

## 3. Trouble-shooting
* My file opens in an editor instead of a browser
    * Right click and select "Open With..."
* My browser shows my tags
    * Check that file extenstion is .html
* I changed my code, but my page looks the same
    * Refresh your browser
    * Verify file name
* I get "weird" characters
    * Try typing code in by hand, not copy-and-paste
